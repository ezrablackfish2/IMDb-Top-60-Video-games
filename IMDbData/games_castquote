1,"Some of the things I'm most proud of, it isn't because I think it's my best work; it's because of something that it's taught me.",2b9ab4b9-ead2-489e-8282-596600fc4abe
2,"Definitely when you get handed roles like Joel in 'The Last of Us,' that's something that will change your life, and I learned so much from that role.",2b9ab4b9-ead2-489e-8282-596600fc4abe
3,"I'm always nervous! Especially when it comes to a series like 'Disgaea', where you do have such a devoted fan base, the last thing you want to do is disappoint. But I love playing bad guys and just always hope that fans will be forgiving if I miss the mark.",2b9ab4b9-ead2-489e-8282-596600fc4abe
4,"A lot people ask me, 'How do I become a voice actor?' and, well, first of all, drop the 'voice' because you don't know what mechanics you'll have to employ. If you can just focus on the acting, then the rest will come.",2b9ab4b9-ead2-489e-8282-596600fc4abe
5,"I don't ever want it to be about me. A friend of mine told me, 'The difference between fame and notoriety is fame is when people know you, and notoriety is when people know your work.' The first one is not respectable, but the second one is, because that leaves a legacy.",2b9ab4b9-ead2-489e-8282-596600fc4abe
6,"I would have to say that I have to concentrate more when I'm doing comedy. There are so many details that make up any character, but developing a character for a dramatic role seems to come more naturally.",ec33104e-635c-41eb-b523-f42620e10ca4
7,It's really important that people know about it and the issue in schools because it happens every day to people and it really hurts when people get bullied.,ec33104e-635c-41eb-b523-f42620e10ca4
8,"When someone is bullying you, don't let it get to you. I remember my friends in school, someone said something mean to them, and they really let it get to them. And it really affected them. But I would just say try to ignore it as much as possible and just be yourself.",ec33104e-635c-41eb-b523-f42620e10ca4
9,Last Man Standing (2011) is overall a lot of comedy. And I love doing that.,ec33104e-635c-41eb-b523-f42620e10ca4
10,I love going back and forth from drama to comedy. I love switching it around and showing people that I can do both.,ec33104e-635c-41eb-b523-f42620e10ca4
11,I've been very fortunate in my career.,54023a1f-2b3e-4719-96ca-11e8f06cdb78
12,"I know you hear horror stories about child actors, but I think in my family when I did start acting it was never a big deal.",54023a1f-2b3e-4719-96ca-11e8f06cdb78
13,"Pancakes are my favourite food, along with donuts, I really enjoy circles.",54023a1f-2b3e-4719-96ca-11e8f06cdb78
14,"(When asked about what advice he would give people interested in the acting field) ""The advice that I can give anyone wanting to be in the biz: do all the work, learn your craft. There are no shortcuts. If you stay with it, you will get an opportunity. Whether you make the most of an opportunity depends on if you are prepared. Learn your craft, every aspect of it. Eat it, drink it, sleep it, then when you are the most prepared, you can make the most of it.""",68c4f035-10be-4527-b745-41b536c85fe3
15,"(When asked about his inspiration growing up) ""My number one inspiration was my mother. She worked two jobs and had breakfast and dinner prepared. I essentially called my mother, The Lion. She's fierce and she's proud. I'd like to think some of that rubbed off on me. In the film industry, Sidney Poitier, in a broader sense, Muhammad Ali. He put his beliefs above any monetary value. That's why his celebrity has never waned. Movies, TV, sports, come and go, but what you stand for is what people remember. Mandela, Martin Luther King, John Kennedy are people who really stood for something and were willing to die for it. You don't see a whole lot of that any more.""",68c4f035-10be-4527-b745-41b536c85fe3
16,"[on being nominated opposite Nicole Kidman at the 2016 Laurence Olivier awards] Well, if I win and Nicole Kidman is there, I'm going to say, there's no way I thought I would win because Nicole is here and see how that goes down. The thing is, you've got 40 seconds, so it all becomes a performance in itself. Maybe I'll steal some forks.",d919abb9-8ced-4588-a7c8-c95fb7db2e0f
17,"[on the success of People, Places and Things] I cannot tell you how grateful I am. But that doesn't mean I don't feel worthy of it either. People mistake gratitude for a false modesty. That's not what I'm about. But how lucky am I? What a life! This is my f**king life and I was trying to be a cleaner. Isn't it funny?",d919abb9-8ced-4588-a7c8-c95fb7db2e0f
18,"[on playing the role of drug addict Emma in ""People, Places and Things""] I felt it was my responsibility to tell the truth. I've seen actresses play actresses who are addicts, and they could not have been more self-indulgent. The most valuable feedback came not from the press, though that was great, but from the addicts themselves. Before we opened at the National, one of the people from the local treatment center shouted out from the audience, ""Good girl!"" and I thought, that's who I'm representing; that's the story we're telling.",d919abb9-8ced-4588-a7c8-c95fb7db2e0f
19,"[on the possibility of winning the Olivier award for ""People, Places and Things, 16 March 2016 interview] I'd be wanting to talk about gender parity and racial equality, because I'd want to talk about all the amazing black women this past year who haven't been nominated, like Noma Dumezweni in Linda: I'm sorry but if she were a white actress, she'd have been up for an Olivier. So I've got a lot to fit in.",d919abb9-8ced-4588-a7c8-c95fb7db2e0f
20,"[on voicing the Penguin] The Penguin from Batman: Arkham City is a real departure from what I'm most known for. People actually didn't realize it was me. That's the one thing about doing voice over work that people don't realize, and you can interview anybody in this industry-you have to be a good actor as well as having a good voice.",da8bd860-c82b-4931-a426-0f6cf3032652
21,"[on why he switched from being a reporter to being a voice actor] I studied journalism at The University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. I did my graduate work at Emerson in Boston and I was actually a reporter for a year in New York and New Jersey. It dawned on me that I wasn't cut out for that line of work. I mean... there's a certain thing that really good reports have that I just didn't. Some of my stories were just mired in stuff that wasn't my cup of tea. I covered a teen shooting victim in Newark, a house fire in Jersey City, and all around they were just some really grizzly stories-didn't like the vibe. Much like the Nathan Drake character in Uncharted, I kind of fell back on my sense of humor to keep my sanity. Maybe it's truly my defense mechanism, but y'know I just wanted out of it-I wanted to do something different. I considered going with ESPN or doing The Daily Show, but it just came to a point where I didn't see that happening. I eventually became an actor, starting wit",da8bd860-c82b-4931-a426-0f6cf3032652
22,"I mean, Gary Oldman, one of the greatest actors on the planet, did Call of Duty. He wouldn't have done it 10 years ago. It's a new age dawning, and I'm just really proud to be part of.",da8bd860-c82b-4931-a426-0f6cf3032652
23,"I think starting in anime, like I did, gave me a good idea of how to approach games that come from Japan. Japanese developers can be very different from companies here in the western market.",d4154455-a670-455a-adaa-5533c77a34bb
24,I guess anime helped me understand the Japanese culture a little better and makes me want to honor certain language nuances that don't always translate to English.,d4154455-a670-455a-adaa-5533c77a34bb
25,"It's nice, because after you've worked with various directors and producers enough times, they start to know your voice and what you're capable of.",d4154455-a670-455a-adaa-5533c77a34bb
26,It's fun to grow with a character over the course of a TV series. Video games are usually a much more condensed process.,d4154455-a670-455a-adaa-5533c77a34bb
