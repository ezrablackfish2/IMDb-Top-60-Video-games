This gives the player the perk ""lovers embrace."" The player can find women throughout the world, who may flirt with the player (absolutely nothing graphic, generally something to the extent of ""hi baby"").","About as violent as its predecessors, though it can get more violent depending on the situation. The most common enemies are monsters which emit a lot of blood. The violence is absolutely not constant. The game is about exploring the world and finishing quests which occasionally involve violence. However, when this happens, it can be very graphic. Some side quest missions are focused on combat. The game includes a social pressure mechanic where the most companions disapprove of needless violence. Others, however, encourage it. As players traverse the open-world environment, they complete various mission objectives and use machine guns, machetes, lasers, and explosives to kill mutants and other human survivors. Battles are frenetic with realistic gunfire, explosions, and large blood-splatter effects; some attacks result in slow-motion dismemberment and decapitations. A handful of scenes depict chunks of flesh as well as severed heads and dismembered corpses. 'Fallout 4' contains graphic","The words ""f**k,"" ""sh*t,"" and ""a*shole"" are heard in dialogue. All bad language can be disabled in settings A lot of swear words used except extremely vulgar ones. Once in a very long while you may just hear an F word.

Also s**t, crap Other mild expletives such as 'piss', 'damn/dammit', etc are also used throughout the game.","During the course of the game, players can consume a variety of fictional drugs (e.g., Buffout, Jet, Psycho) through the use of a menu; repeated use of these drugs leads to an addiction status and various negative effects for characters. In the silver shroud mission, there is talk of a man selling drugs to children. The player can drink alcohol, and take fictional drugs. All of these things enhance the players abilities for a given amount of time and then wears off, however the player can become addicted to any one of these things. Getting addicted lowers the players stats until they take the drug again or see a doctor. There are many people that will buy/sell drugs. The player can find a city where there are a ton of junkies. Certain enemies take drugs before a fight or talk about taking them. The player does have the option, however, to not take a single drug throughout the entire game.","Not recommended for anyone under the age of 14 years old. The game can be violent but because of the rarity of the violence and the overall lack of other mature content, it can be played by teens (14+) There's an are called the Glowing Sea where there's a very scary atmosphere and also many scary creatures like Radscorpions. Bumping into a shopping cart which's way louder than almost anything else in the game WILL scare almost every player, no matter how old or young they are. I say that this game should either be playable for the age 15 or 16 years old should be recomendable for people 15 or 16 to play. The entire game, just like the rest of the Fallout series, revolves around a post-nuclear future in which America is now an apocalyptic wasteland (the game takes place in Boston and its surrounding areas.)

The camera is in first person and Quiet is still in her bikini, however Quiet is in focus during this cutscene. And the male characters around her cell watch her as she showers. The character Quiet wears nothing but a bikini top, bikini bottom and pantyhose that reveal and accentuate her breasts and buttocks. In one scene, she strips out of her pantyhose and rolls around in the rain - becoming slick and wet. In another scene, if Venom Snake doesn't shower for a long time, Quiet will take a shower with him (albeit clothed in her bikini).

How violent the combat is in this game depends on how far you are from the enemy. In close quarters combat, there is a big splash of blood (slightly more violent than Tomb Raider (2013).). But when sniping or from a distance, there is no blood (or the spray is so small or far away that you can't see it). There is not much over-the-top violence during actual gameplay; there is a small blood splash when Snake shoots an enemy, and that's pretty much it. Violent cutscenes are few and far between, but they are very gory. However, all cutscenes are skippable. The game rewards you if you choose to go about a mission with nonviolent methods. However it's important to note that killing enemies often makes missions far easier to complete.

The player may use these cigars whenever they please to speed up the course of time during the day or night. On the player's birthday, a humorous scene plays where Snake is given a cigar for his surprise birthday party. But he is never allowed to smoke it. If players have Quiet at this point, she will light a cigar for Snake by shooting it.","Metal Gear has always been philosophical and does not shy away from dark deep themes. The themes in this game is child soldier, war, lack of ""real"" choices in life, America's influence on everything, rape, sex, identity, regret, and leadership. If Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain was a movie it would probably be classified as Rated R for violence, some grisly images, language, some sexual references, and drug content. There is only a blood splash when Snake shoots an enemy. However, if you wound the enemy soldider enough, he will scream and then writhe on the ground in pain. The soldiers' realistic reactions to being shot can be disturbing. The game is played in a way that where a lot of pressure is put on the player to not be caught by enemies.
